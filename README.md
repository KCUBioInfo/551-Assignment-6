## Assignment 6: Motifs

 

## Problem 1: Brute Force (15 pts)

Write a function named median_string(dna,k) that takes in a set of dna sequence strings named dna and k-mer length k. This function should implement the “better” version of brute force motif finding discussed in lecture and described on p. 82. Note: best practices suggest that you would want to also create a function for calculating d(Pattern, Dna), and possibly other functions to solve this problem.

 

## Problem 2: Greedy Algorithm (15 pts)

Write a function named greedy_motif_search() that implements the GreedyMotifSearch pseudocode on p. 86 of the textbook. Be sure to use LaPlace Succession when calculating profile.

 

## Problem 3: Random Algorithm (15 pts)

Write a function named randomized_motif_search() that implements the RandomizedMotifSearch pseudocode on p. 94 of the textbook.

 

## Problem 4: Gibbs Sampler (15 pts)

Write a function named gibbs_sampler() that implements the Gibbs Sampling algorithm (textbook p. 101) for motif finding.
